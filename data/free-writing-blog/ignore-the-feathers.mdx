summary: 'Every team has more good ideas than capacity. The hard part is selection — learning to see past the costly signals, prestigious credentials, and compelling narratives to focus on what actually moves the number.'

Every team I've worked with has more good ideas than capacity. That's never the problem. The problem is selection — how do you look at thirty directions and pick the five that matter, when every direction comes wrapped in expertise, credentials, and a compelling narrative? For that, we need to talk about peacocks. Bear with me.

In 1975, Amotz Zahavi proposed the handicap principle: a signal is credible *precisely because it's costly to produce*. The peacock's tail — three feet of iridescent absurdity that basically screams "eat me" to every predator — works as a mating signal not despite being ridiculous, but *because* it's ridiculous. Only a genuinely fit bird can walk around looking like a Vegas showgirl and survive. A weak bird trying the same thing gets eaten before the first date.

Nature solved trust. Make the signal expensive, and fakers die. But notice: it's *local*. One peacock, a few peahens, one territory. Genes pass to a handful of offspring. Damage contained.

We don't live in that world.

What changed isn't one shift — it's two. The first: we stopped passing genes and started passing ideas. Ideas spread further and faster, but initially the mechanism was the same — person to person. You influence who you know, and they can push back, verify. The signal stays honest because the interaction stays personal.

The second shift breaks everything. You can't know everyone. Can't sit across from every person you want to influence. So you stop talking to people and start telling stories. You broadcast. You attach ideas to a narrative, and the narrative travels where you can't.

"I'm a Bayesian." "We're in information retrieval." "We're data scientists." These aren't knowledge claims. They're tribal flags. You plant one, join a tribe, and the tribe becomes a propagation network. Ideas travel through it regardless of whether they're *correct*. The tribe cites tribal papers, hires tribal people, promotes tribal frameworks. And grows. Always grows.

The researcher's costly signal — real PhD, real credentials, real years of grinding — passes ideas to thousands. Nobody is faking. The cost is genuine. But the *function* has shifted from quality to spread. Fancy papers that never include the embarrassing baseline. Research agendas shaped by what *travels well* rather than what works. The expertise is real. The relationship to measurable improvement is optional.

It looks exactly like a peacock's tail. It just isn't one anymore.

Harry Frankfurt distinguished liars from bullshitters. A liar knows truth and hides it. A bullshitter doesn't care about truth at all — it's not the operative variable. Frankfurt argued bullshit is worse than lying, because at least the liar respects truth enough to work around it.

We celebrate this. We call it "fake it till you make it." But that's low-functioning bullshit — easy to spot. I want to name something harder: **high-functioning bullshit**.

High-functioning bullshit is what happens when genuine expertise, genuine credentials, and genuinely costly signals get pointed not at truth — but at influence. The relationship to facts becomes optional. The relationship to spread becomes everything.

And it's uncatchable because it fools the bullshitter first. The researcher has internalized the tribal narrative so deeply that sophistication *feels* like rigor. They defend their approach with authentic conviction because the conviction *is* authentic. You can't find inconsistencies — there aren't any. You can't detect insincerity — there is none. The self-deception isn't a bug. It's the armor.

The only thing missing is contact with reality — *has anyone tested this?* — and that question never feels urgent when the narrative is this polished. It would feel almost rude.

Taleb saw part of this. Skin in the game: a signal is credible when the signaler bears the downside. This worked in villages — face-to-face, long memory. But we left the village. The researcher who championed the fancy approach has moved companies by the time you discover the boring alternative worked. Their reputation is intact. Your roadmap absorbed the cost.

People notice, of course. Engineers call out over-engineering. Simplicity is the real skill! Then something beautiful and terrible happens. SmolLM. Minimalism. The critique of the peacock's tail grows its own feathers — new tribe, new costly signal, new propagation network. The meta-game absorbs the critique and keeps running.

If even the rejection of high-functioning bullshit becomes high-functioning bullshit, where do you stand?

Here's where you stand. In a room, staring at a whiteboard full of ideas, all of them wrapped in beautiful plumage. You have a team. A quarter. Real metrics tied to real outcomes that someone above you will actually check. You're not selecting mating partners. You're trying to make a number go up.

And every idea in the room has a peacock behind it. The one with the prestigious paper. The one with the conference keynote. The one who built the thing at the other company. All of them radiating genuine, hard-won, expensively acquired confidence. All of them sincere. None of them lying. Not one of them personally on the hook if the number doesn't move.

That's you. That's the hook. The peacocks get to walk away with their tails intact. You get the dashboard.

What makes it worse: sometimes the peacock is right. And discounting expertise wholesale is just another tribal flag — a lazy one. You can't tell the difference between an expert who's right and an expert who's captured. They look identical, sound identical, feel identical from the inside. So stop trying to tell the difference. Test the idea instead of judging the bird.

There's no clean exit from this. You can't verify everything. That's Tuesday. But you don't have to sit there admiring feathers.

**Bring skin back locally.** Pre-commit to kill thresholds before anyone is emotionally invested. If an idea's author won't define what failure looks like, the tail is doing the talking.

**Time-box and invalidate fast.** High-functioning bullshit thrives in long planning cycles where stories harden before anyone experiments. Two weeks, clear metric, go or stop. Even deep R&D can answer one question: *what would we expect to see in two weeks if this were going to work?* If the answer is "nothing, just trust the vision" — feathers.

**Stay skeptical of narratives, including this one.** "Just watch the metrics" is also a story. Goodhart's ghost haunts every dashboard ever built. But a metric argues back. A narrative just sits there being elegant. When you chase the wrong number, the number eventually tells you. When you chase the wrong narrative, nothing breaks — it just *feels right*, quarter after quarter, until someone runs the embarrassing baseline and the room goes quiet.

Give every idea a score: **expected metric lift × confidence × inverse cost**. It's much harder to bullshit three dimensions than one narrative. Confidence must be *justified*, not felt — what evidence actually exists? Cost means time-to-first-signal — how fast can we know if this works at all? Stack rank, allocate top-down, no debates about elegance.

When something doesn't survive data — that's the most expensive thing in your org: a fast answer. The person who kills an idea early bought back months. Make that more prestigious than the person whose idea survived by never being tested.

The peacock's tail works because the cost is real and the feedback is local. You can't fix the world's signaling problem. But you can fix the room. Make the cost land on the idea, not on your roadmap. Make the feedback loop shorter than a career move.

The feathers are gorgeous. Ignore them. Watch the number. And when the number lies — at least you'll know. The narrative never even offered you that.
